## Top Earners
We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly **_salary * worked_**, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the **Employee** table. 
Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. Then print these values as **2** space-separated integers.

### Input Format
The **Employee** table containing employee data for a company is described as follows:
| Column      | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| employee_id | Integer |
| name        | String  |
| months      | Integer |
| salary      | Integer |

where employee_id is an employee's ID number, name is their name, months is the total number of months they've been working for the company, and salary is the their monthly salary.

### Sample Input
| employee_id | name     | months | salary |
|-------------|----------|--------|--------|
| 12228       | Rose     | 15     | 1968   |
| 33645       | Angela   | 1      | 3443   |
| 45692       | Frank    | 17     | 1608   |
| 56118       | Patrick  | 7      | 1345   |
| 59724       | Lisa     | 11     | 2330   |
| 74197       | Kimberly | 16     | 4372   |
| 78454       | Bonnie   | 8      | 1771   |
| 83565       | Michael  | 6      | 2017   |
| 98607       | Todd     | 5      | 3396   |
| 99989       | Joe      | 9      | 3573   |

### Sample Output
```
69952 1
```

### Explanation
The table and earnings data is depicted in the following diagram:
| employee_id | name     | months | salary | earnings |
|-------------|----------|--------|--------|----------|
| 12228       | Rose     | 15     | 1968   | 29520    |
| 33645       | Angela   | 1      | 3443   | 3443     |
| 45692       | Frank    | 17     | 1608   | 27336    |
| 56118       | Patrick  | 7      | 1345   | 9415     |
| 59724       | Lisa     | 11     | 2330   | 25630    |
| 74197       | Kimberly | 16     | 4372   | 69952    |
| 78454       | Bonnie   | 8      | 1771   | 14168    |
| 83565       | Michael  | 6      | 2017   | 12102    |
| 98607       | Todd     | 5      | 3396   | 16980    |
| 99989       | Joe      | 9      | 3573   | 32157    |

The maximum earnings value is **69952**. The only employee with earnings = **69952** is Kimberly, so we print the maximum earnings value (**69952**) and a count of the number of employees who have earned **$69952** (which is 1) as two space-separated values.

## Answer (MySQL)
```
SELECT 
    (salary*months) AS earnings, 
    COUNT(*)
FROM employee
GROUP BY earnings
ORDER BY earnings DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
