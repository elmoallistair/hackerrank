# Day 1: Functions

## Objective
Today, we're discussing JavaScript functions. Check out the attached tutorial for more details.

## Task
Implement a function named factorial that has one parameter: an integer, `n`. It must return the value of `n!` (i.e., `n` factorial).

## Input Format
Locked stub code in the editor reads a single integer, `n`, from stdin and passes it to a function named factorial.

## Constraints
* 1 &le; `n` &le; 10

## Output Format
The function must return the value of `n!`.

Sample Input 0
```
4
```

## Sample Output 0
```
24
```

## Explanation 0
We return the value of 4! = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24.
