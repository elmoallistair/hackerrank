## Objective
In this challenge, we practice looping over the characters of string. Check out the attached tutorial for more details.

## Task
Complete the vowelsAndConsonants function in the editor below. It has one parameter, a string, `s`, consisting of lowercase English alphabetic letters (i.e., a through z). The function must do the following:
1. First, print each vowel in `s` on a new line. The English vowels are a, e, i, o, and u, and each vowel must be printed in the same order as it appeared in `s`.
2. Second, print each consonant (i.e., non-vowel) in `s` on a new line in the same order as it appeared in `s`.

## Input Format
Locked stub code in the editor reads string `s` from stdin and passes it to the function.

## Output Format
First, print each vowel in `s` on a new line (in the same order as they appeared in `s`). 
Second, print each consonant (i.e. `s`, non-vowel) in on a new line (in the same order as they appeared in `s`).

Observe the following:
* Each letter is printed on a new line.
* Then the vowels are printed in the same order as they appeared in `s`.
* Then the consonants are printed in the same order as they appeared in `s`.
